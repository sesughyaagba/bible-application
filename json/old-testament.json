    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."

    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."

    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."

    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."

    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."

    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."

    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."

    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."

    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."

    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."

    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."

    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."

    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."

    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."

    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."

    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."

    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."

    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."

    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."

    "1": "1 The proverbs of Solomon, King David's son, from Israel: 2 Their purpose is to teach wisdom and discipline, to help one understand wise sayings. 3 They provide insightful instruction, which is righteous, just, and full of integrity. 4 They make the naive mature, the young knowledgeable and discreet. 5 The wise hear them and grow in wisdom; those with understanding gain guidance. 6 They help one understand proverbs and difficult sayings, the words of the wise, and their puzzles. 7 Wisdom begins with the fear of the LORD, but fools despise wisdom and instruction. 8 Listen, my son, to your father's instruction; don't neglect your mother's teaching; 9 for they are a graceful wreath on your head, and beads for your neck. 10 My son, don't let sinners entice you. Don't go 11 when they say: 'Come with us. Let's set up a deadly ambush. Let's secretly wait for the innocent just for fun. 12 Let's swallow up the living like the grave— whole, like those who go down into the pit. 13 We'll find all sorts of precious wealth; we'll fill our houses with plunder. 14 Throw in your lot with us; we'll share our money.' 15 My son, don't go on the path with them; keep your feet from their way, 16 because their feet run to evil; they hurry to spill blood. 17 It's useless to cast a net in the sight of a bird. 18 But these sinners set up a deadly ambush; they lie in wait for their own lives. 19 These are the ways of all who seek unjust gain; it costs them their lives. 20 Wisdom shouts in the street; in the public square she raises her voice.",
    "2": "1 My son, accept my words and store up my commands. 2 Turn your ear toward wisdom, and stretch your mind toward understanding. 3 Call out for insight, and cry aloud for understanding. 4 Seek it like silver; search for it like hidden treasure. 5 Then you will understand the fear of the LORD, and discover the knowledge of God. 6 The LORD gives wisdom; from his mouth come knowledge and understanding. 7 He reserves ability for those with integrity. He is a shield for those who live a blameless life. 8 He protects the paths of justice and guards the way of those who are loyal to him. 9 Then you will understand righteousness and justice, as well as integrity, every good course. 10 Wisdom will enter your mind, and knowledge will fill you with delight. 11 Discretion will guard you; understanding will protect you. 12 Wisdom will rescue you from the evil path, from people who twist their words. 13 They forsake the way of integrity and go on obscure paths. 14 They enjoy doing evil, rejoicing in their twisted evil. 15 Their paths are confused; they get lost on their way. 16 Wisdom will rescue you from the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman with her slick words. 17 She leaves behind the partner of her youth; she even forgets her covenant with God. 18 Her house sinks down to death, and her paths go down to the shadowy dead. 19 All those who go to her will never return; they will never again reach the ways of the living. 20 So you should stay on the path of good people, guarding the road of the righteous.",
    "3": "1 My son, don't forget my instruction. Let your heart guard my commands, 2 because they will help you live a long time and provide you with well-being. 3 Don't let loyalty and faithfulness leave you. Bind them on your neck; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Then you will find favor and approval in the eyes of God and humanity. 5 Trust in the LORD with all your heart; don't rely on your own intelligence. 6 Know him in all your paths, and he will keep your ways straight. 7 Don't consider yourself wise. Fear the LORD and turn away from evil. 8 Then your body will be healthy and your bones strengthened. 9 Honor the LORD with your wealth and with the first of all your crops. 10 Then your barns will be filled with plenty, and your vats will burst with wine. 11 Don't reject the instruction of the LORD, my son; don't despise his correction. 12 The LORD loves those he corrects, just like a father who treats his son with favor. 13 Happy are those who find wisdom and those who gain understanding. 14 Her profit is better than silver, and her gain better than gold. 15 Her value exceeds pearls; all you desire can't compare with her. 16 In her right hand is a long life; in her left are wealth and honor. 17 Her ways are pleasant; all her paths are peaceful. 18 She is a tree of life to those who embrace her; those who hold her tight are happy. 19 The LORD laid the foundations of the earth with wisdom, establishing the heavens with understanding. 20 With his knowledge, the watery depths burst open, and the skies drop dew.",
    "4": "1 Hear, children, fatherly instruction; pay attention to gain understanding. 2 I'll teach you well. Don't abandon my instruction. 3 When I was a son to my father, tender and my mother's favorite, 4 he taught me and said to me: 'Let your heart hold on to my words: Keep my commands and live. 5 Get wisdom; get understanding. Don't forget and don't turn away from my words. 6 Don't abandon her, and she will guard you. Love her, and she will protect you. 7 The beginning of wisdom: Get wisdom! Get understanding before anything else. 8 Highly esteem her, and she will exalt you. She will honor you if you embrace her. 9 She will place a graceful wreath on your head; she will give you a glorious crown.' 10 Listen, my son, and take in my speech, then the years of your life will be many. 11 I teach you the path of wisdom. I lead you in straight courses. 12 When you walk, you won't be hindered; when you run, you won't stumble. 13 Hold on to instruction; don't slack off; protect it, for it is your life. 14 Don't go on the way of the wicked; don't walk on the path of evil people. 15 Avoid it! Don't turn onto it; stay off of it and keep going! 16 They don't sleep unless they do evil; they are robbed of sleep unless they make someone stumble. 17 They eat the bread of evil, and they drink the wine of violence. 18 The way of the righteous is like morning light that gets brighter and brighter till it is full day. 19 The path of the wicked is like deep darkness; they don't know where they will stumble. 20 My son, pay attention to my words. Bend your ear to my speech.",
    "5": "1 My son, pay attention to my wisdom. Bend your ear to what I know, 2 so you might remain discreet, and your lips might guard knowledge. 3 The lips of a mysterious woman drip honey, and her tongue is smoother than oil, 4 but in the end she is bitter as gall, sharp as a double-edged sword. 5 Her feet go down to death; her steps lead to the grave. 6 She doesn't stay on the way of life. Her paths wander, but she doesn't know it. 7 Now children, listen to me, and don't deviate from the words of my mouth. 8 Stay on a path that is far from her; don't approach the entrance to her house. 9 Otherwise, you will give your strength to others, your years to a cruel person. 10 Otherwise, strangers will sap your strength, and your hard work will end up in a foreigner's house. 11 You will groan at the end when your body and flesh are exhausted, 12 and you say, 'How I hated instruction! How my heart despised correction! 13 I didn't listen to the voice of my instructor. I didn't obey my teacher. 14 I'm on the brink of utter ruin in the assembled community.' 15 Drink water from your own cistern, gushing water from your own well. 16 Should your fountains flood outside, streams of water in the public squares? 17 They are yours alone, not for you as well as strangers. 18 May your spring be blessed. Rejoice in the wife of your youth. 19 She is a lovely deer, a graceful doe. Let her breasts intoxicate you all the time; always be drunk on her love. 20 Why, my son, should you lose your senses with a mysterious woman and embrace the breasts of a foreign female?",
    "6": "1 My son, if you guarantee a loan for your neighbor or shake hands in agreement with a stranger, 2 you will be trapped by your words; you will be caught by your words. 3 Do this, my son, to get out of it, for you have come under the control of your neighbor. So go, humble yourself, and pester your neighbor. 4 Don't give sleep to your eyes or slumber to your eyelids. 5 Get yourself free like a gazelle from a hunter, like a bird from the hand of a fowler. 6 Go to the ant, you lazy person; observe its ways and grow wise. 7 The ant has no commander, officer, or ruler. 8 Even so, it gets its food in summer; gathers its provisions at harvest. 9 How long, lazy person, will you lie down? When will you rise from your sleep? 10 A little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding of the arms to lie down— 11 and poverty will come on you like a prowler, destitution like a warrior. 12 Worthless people and guilty people go around with crooked talk. 13 They wink their eyes, gesture with their feet, and point with their fingers. 14 Their hearts are corrupt and determined to do evil; they create controversies all the time. 15 Therefore, sudden disaster will come upon them; they will be quickly broken beyond healing. 16 There are six things that the LORD hates, seven things detestable to him: 17 snobbish eyes, a lying tongue, hands that spill innocent blood, 18 a heart set on wicked plans, feet that run quickly to evil, 19 a false witness who breathes lies, and one who causes conflicts among relatives. 20 My son, keep your father's command; don't abandon your mother's instruction.",
    "7": "1 My son, keep my words; store up my commands within you. 2 Keep my commands and live, and my instruction like the pupil of your eye. 3 Bind them on your fingers; write them on the tablet of your heart. 4 Say to wisdom, 'You are my sister'; call understanding 'friend,' 5 so she might guard you against the mysterious woman, from the foreign woman who flatters you. 6 When from the window of my house, from behind the screen, I gazed down, 7 I looked among the naive young men and noticed among the youth, one who had no sense. 8 He was crossing the street at her corner and walked down the path to her house 9 in the early evening, at the onset of night and darkness. 10 All of a sudden a woman approaches him, dressed like a prostitute and with a cunning mind. 11 She is noisy and defiant; her feet don't stay long in her own house. 12 She has one foot in the street, one foot in the public square. She lies in wait at every corner. 13 She grabs him and kisses him. Her face is brazen as she speaks to him: 14 'I've made a sacrifice of well-being; today I fulfilled my solemn promises. 15 So I've come out to meet you, seeking you, and I have found you. 16 I've spread my bed with luxurious covers, with colored linens from Egypt. 17 I've sprinkled my bed with myrrh, aloes, and cinnamon. 18 Come, let's drink deep of love until morning; let's savor our lovemaking. 19 For my husband isn't home; he's gone far away. 20 He took a pouch of money with him; he won't come home till full moon.'",
    "8": "1 Doesn't Wisdom cry out and Understanding shout? 2 Atop the heights along the path, at the crossroads she takes her stand. 3 By the gate before the city, at the entrances she shouts: 4 I cry out to you, people; my voice goes out to all of humanity. 5 Understand skill, you who are naive. Take this to heart, you fools. 6 Listen, for I speak things that are correct; from my lips comes what is right. 7 My mouth utters the truth; my lips despise wickedness. 8 All the words of my mouth are righteous; nothing in them is twisted or crooked. 9 All of them are straightforward to those who understand, and upright for the knowledgeable. 10 Take my instruction rather than silver, knowledge rather than choice gold. 11 Wisdom is better than pearls; nothing is more delightful than she. 12 I, Wisdom, dwell with prudence; I have found knowledge and discretion. 13 To fear the LORD is to hate evil. I hate pride and arrogance, the path of evil and corrupt speech. 14 I have advice and ability, as well as understanding and strength. 15 By me kings rule, and princes issue righteous decrees. 16 By me rulers govern, and officials judge righteously. 17 I love those who love me; those who seek me will find me. 18 Riches and honor are with me, as well as enduring wealth and righteousness. 19 My fruit is better than gold, even fine gold; my crops are better than choice silver. 20 I walk on the way of righteousness, on the paths of justice,",
    "9": "1 Wisdom built her house; she has carved out her seven pillars. 2 She slaughtered her animals, mixed her wine, and set her table. 3 She sends out her female servants; she issues an invitation from the top of the city heights: 4 'Whoever is naive turn aside here,' she says to those who lack sense. 5 'Come, eat my food, and drink the wine I have mixed. 6 Abandon your simplistic ways and live; walk in the way of understanding.' 7 Whoever instructs the cynic gets insulted; whoever corrects the wicked gets hurt. 8 Don't correct the impudent, or they will hate you; correct the wise, and they will love you. 9 Teach the wise, and they will become wiser; inform the righteous, and their learning will increase. 10 The beginning of wisdom is the fear of the LORD; the knowledge of the holy one is understanding. 11 Through me your days will be many; years will be added to your life. 12 If you are wise, it is to your benefit; if you are cynical, you will bear it all alone. 13 Woman Folly is noisy; she's stupid and doesn't even know it. 14 She sits at the doorway of her house, on a seat at the city heights. 15 She invites those who pass by on the path, those going straight on their way. 16 'Whoever is naive, come in here,' she says to those who lack sense. 17 'Stolen water is sweet; food eaten in secret is pleasant.' 18 But they don't know that the dead are there; her guests are in the depths of the grave. 19 The LORD detests dishonest scales, but delights in an accurate weight. 20 When pride comes, so does shame, but wisdom brings humility.",
    "10": "1 The proverbs of Solomon: A wise child makes a father glad, but a foolish child brings sorrow to his mother. 2 The treasure of the wicked won't profit them, but righteousness rescues people from death. 3 The LORD doesn't let the righteous starve, but he rejects the desires of the wicked. 4 Laziness brings poverty; hard work makes one rich. 5 A wise son harvests in the summer; a disgraceful son sleeps right through the harvest. 6 Blessings cover the head of the righteous, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 7 The memory of the righteous is a blessing, but the name of the wicked rots. 8 The skilled mind accepts commands, but a foolish talker is ruined. 9 Those who walk in innocence walk with confidence, but those on crooked paths will be found out. 10 Those who wink an eye bring trouble; those who speak foolishly are ruined. 11 The mouth of the righteous is a fountain of life, but the mouth of the wicked conceals violence. 12 Hate stirs up conflict, but love covers all offenses. 13 Wisdom is found on the lips of those who have understanding, but there is a rod for the back of those with no sense. 14 The wise store up knowledge, but the mouth of a fool brings on ruin. 15 The riches of the wealthy are their strong city; the ruin of the poor is their poverty. 16 The wages of the righteous lead to life; the earnings of the wicked lead to sin. 17 Those who heed instruction are on the way to life, but those who ignore correction lose their way. 18 Lying lips conceal hate, and those who spread slander are fools. 19 With lots of words comes wrongdoing, but the wise restrain their lips. 20 The tongue of the righteous is choice silver, but the heart of the wicked lacks value."
